The Indian Premier League (IPL) stands as a professional Twenty20 cricket league held annually in India, typically spanning March or April through May. Eight teams, each representing distinct cities across India, compete in this prestigious league. Established in 2008, the IPL was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
